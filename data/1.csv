24,1,agent_2,It's serious intimidation by Iowa! I wonder if it actually works?,Sports
25,1,agent_1,Who knows? lol  In the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars of that time.,Sports
26,1,agent_2,That's strange. Kellen Moore is the only left handed QB.,Sports
27,1,agent_1,I know.  I don't even know who he is?  lol,Other
28,1,agent_2,He's the one throwing the ball with the wrong hand. Brad Johnson is much more talented. He throws and catches TDs.,Sports

34,1,agent_2,Yeah. 6 years with 2 teams. He was a good player.,Sports
35,1,agent_1,LOL  ESPN won an emmy for the superimposed yellow first down line they created.  I would be lost without it.,Other

37,1,agent_1,Right? Lol. Do you play any fantasy sports? There's actually a fantasy draft for the National Spelling Bee.,Games
38,1,agent_2,"Yes and I am one of the losers (my word, not yours) that made the national spelling bee a drinking game. I took the day off of work for it!",Games

44,2,agent_1,"Me neither, but it seems a nice city, the National Mall in spring is filled with cherry trees in bloom.",Travel_Geo
45,2,agent_2,I've seen pictures.  Yes it does look beautiful.  I wonder if they have any goldfish in any of those water fountains there?  lol  The oldest goldfish lived to be 43 years old!,Pets_Animals
46,2,agent_1,"That is a long time, I wonder if its remembers those 43 years or only the last 5 minutes. There is also a breed or jellyfish that is immortal. That is longer than 43, but I am not sure that I would want to be an immortal jellyfish.",Pets_Animals
47,2,agent_2,"You and me both!  Since jellyfish are 98% water, they evaporate in the sun!",SciTech
48,2,agent_1,"That must be painful, if they could sense pain. I don't feel bad for them for all the pain they inflict on people.",Pets_Animals
49,2,agent_2,haha  There was a koi fish named Hanako that lived for 226 years!,Pets_Animals
50,2,agent_1,"Fish can be useful for research, the illnesses that can affect the zebrafish also affect humans.",Pets_Animals
51,2,agent_2,Interesting!  There is a species of fish that lives on land all its adult life.  Have no idea what it's called though.  lol,Pets_Animals
52,2,agent_1,"I think it is a mudskipper, I don't know it they live on land, but they can ""walk"".",Pets_Animals
53,2,agent_2,That might be it.  There is a fish called the barreleye fish that has a transparent head.  Do you like dogs?,Pets_Animals
54,2,agent_1,"Yes I like dogs, but I don't have one. They are smart they understand pointing.",Pets_Animals
55,2,agent_2,That's neat!  Some dogs in Moscow have learned to use the subway!,Pets_Animals
56,2,agent_1,"That is smart of them, in Istanbul you can donate empty water bottles and they feed stray dogs with the money.",Pets_Animals
57,2,agent_2,"That's a good idea!  Dogs drink with the underside of their tongues.  So, that is perfect for them.",Pets_Animals
58,2,agent_1,Do you think dogs can dance ? That would be cute.,Pets_Animals
59,2,agent_2,"They might!  If they can learn over a 1000 words and can reason better than chimps, then they might have the ability to learn how to!  Do you like to dance?",Entertainment
60,2,agent_1,"Yeah, but I don't practice much, Bruce Lee must have practiced a lot to win a cha-cha championship.",Entertainment
61,2,agent_2,Nice!  I didn't know he was a dancer.  The first moonwalk ever recorded was performed by tap dancer Bill Bailey in 1955!  It's been fun chatting!,Entertainment
62,2,agent_1,"Martial arts are likes dances, but with more physical contact. Have a nice day.",Other
63,3,agent_1,I've had dogs half my life and never knew they have 12 different bloodtypes.,Pets_Animals
64,3,agent_2,That is amazing. I did not know that either. Dogs can even donate blood at dog blood drives.,Pets_Animals
65,3,agent_1,"Yeah, but makes sense given that there are so many, and they often have operations.",Other
66,3,agent_2,Very true. Did you know instabul has vending machines that release food and water for the cities stray dogs.,Pets_Animals
67,3,agent_1,yes! I've seen it on Facebook. That's so nice what they do to care for the strays.,Other
68,3,agent_2,"speaking of facebook, Did you know Myspace turned down an offer to by Facbook for $75 million?",News
69,3,agent_1,"Yes, I did. Huge mistake since no one uses My Space anymore.",News
70,3,agent_2,Exactly. I did not know that Facebook likes are illegal in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein.,SciTech
71,3,agent_1,Me either. I think the odder fact is the one about Burger King encouraging you to unfriend 10 people.,Other
72,3,agent_2,Yes. I would not even know how that would work. Mark Zuckerburg suffers from re-green colorblindness.,Psychology
73,3,agent_1,"Well, I assume they are tracking the poll results. You can do that when you admin a page. I do.",Politics
74,3,agent_2,Did you know sharks do not have rib cages?,Pets_Animals
75,3,agent_1,"Yes. I think it's one reason they have to keep moving, and they can't live long if they get beached.",Pets_Animals
76,3,agent_2,yes. the weight can kill them,Pets_Animals
77,3,agent_1,"Interesting, that they evolved earlier than dinosaurs and trees but still have that weakness about the rib cage.",SciTech
78,3,agent_2,I wonder how they know that sharks can be trained to bark like dogs. I am not getting that close to find out.,Pets_Animals
79,3,agent_1,"It's probably someting observed by researchers, and they don't say what kind of sharks do this. They aren't all dangerous.",SciTech
80,3,agent_2,That is very true. Great whites meat up in the middle of the pacific ocean and the area is called white shark cafe.,Other
81,3,agent_1,And even they don't attack as often as people think.,Psychology
82,3,agent_2,Nope they have actually rescued sailors.,Pets_Animals
83,3,agent_1,That I am curious to know what sharks have done this.,Psychology
84,3,agent_2,Me too. Did you know that elephants can point like dogs?,Pets_Animals
85,3,agent_1,"Yes, actually have seen them do that.",Movies_TV
86,3,agent_2,Wow that is  incredible,Games

91,3,agent_1,Not really. It's opoid use that's been exploding.,Phatic
92,3,agent_2,This is very true. Doctors are cutting back in prescribing them.,Other
93,3,agent_1,"As they should, they have been overprescribing.",Celebrities
94,3,agent_2,absolutely. It is destroying some families.,Religion
95,3,agent_1,"That article is sad. So many people hide these sorts of problems, and never resolve them.",Literature
96,3,agent_2,It is very sad. It was great chatting with you.,Phatic
97,3,agent_1,Same here!,Phatic
98,3,agent_2,Have a good day.,Phatic
99,4,agent_1,Have you heard about the Disney-Fox merger?  Comcast has dropped their bid.,Entertainment
100,4,agent_2,Interesting. Disney was to pay 71.3 billion dollars.,Entertainment
101,4,agent_1,That's a ton of money.  Their initial bid was $52.4 billion,Other
102,4,agent_2,"Yes, they would get film, television studios and lots of cable channels.",Movies_TV
103,4,agent_1,Disney's stock has gone up to $112.13 after closing up 1.3% on Thursday.  So apparently investors like this deal.,Other
104,4,agent_2,There is also a battle between Comcast and Disney.,Entertainment
105,4,agent_1,"Do you watch Netflix?  Jeff Bezos, Amazon CEO, said they are still the king of streaming entertainment.",Entertainment
106,4,agent_2,"Yes love it, they do face some outside challenges.",Other
107,4,agent_1,"Speaking of Disney, Lion King was their first movie to be translated to Zulo.",Movies_TV
108,4,agent_2,Walt Disney Pictures is regarded as one of the big six studios.,Entertainment
109,4,agent_1,I have heard that Frozen was the first animated Disney film directed by a woman.  That is so great!,Entertainment
110,4,agent_2,Frozen is great. The movie Up was another great hit for the company.,Movies_TV
111,4,agent_1,I agree.  Did you ever play Nintendo?  It could only display 54 colors.  Man we have come a long way!,Games
112,4,agent_2,"Yes, loved it. Yes it was a form of entertainment and delight.",Entertainment
113,4,agent_1,Caesar reported that people bred chickens for entertainment in Britain.  How crazy is that?,Entertainment
114,4,agent_2,"Weird, they consider the nfl entertainment rather than a sport.",Entertainment
115,4,agent_1,Bill Nye the science guy got his break in entertainment because he looked like steve martin.,Entertainment
116,4,agent_2,"He does, television has been used as a mass medium for news and entertainment.",Entertainment
117,4,agent_1,Television is also used as a mass medium for advertising.,Movies_TV
118,4,agent_2,"Yes, most deals on the tv show shark tank are never enacted!",Movies_TV
119,4,agent_1,Really? I have seen that show a few times.,Phatic
120,5,agent_1,Are you a fan of fish?,Pets_Animals
121,5,agent_2,Do you like snakes? I see a fair number of them where I live.,Pets_Animals
122,5,agent_1,Interesting. I had a ball python when I was younger.,Pets_Animals
123,5,agent_2,"Sorry I didn't see your question about fish, btw. I've tried to keep goldfish as pets several times over the years. I had a pet corn snake once too. How big was your python?",Pets_Animals
124,5,agent_1,It wasn't that big. I kept bringing it to school so my parents made me get rid of it. It was an albino ball python. I could put it in my pocket. LOL,Other
125,5,agent_2,"My corn snake was a little under a foot long. It died because it wasn't warm enough in my house during the winter, but not cold enough for it to fully hibernate. I see a lot of snakes here, mostly after my cats kill them.",Pets_Animals
126,5,agent_1,That sucks. So the ball pythons when they are with their owner will roll up into a ball the size of your palm. So I could just put him in my pocket.,Pets_Animals
127,5,agent_2,"I assume there was a negative reaction to bringing him to school, LOL?",Other
128,5,agent_1,"No, everyone thought it was awesome, but they kept calling my parents. So I had to give him back to the aquarium I got him from, but when I was inside I secretly bought an iguana. LOL",Pets_Animals
129,5,agent_2,They were probably sorry they didn't just let you keep the python.,Pets_Animals
130,5,agent_1,"Yeah, I had all types of animals. One time I bought a ferret, that didn't go over so well because they smell.",Pets_Animals
131,5,agent_2,"I got a kick out of the ferrets at the pet store. They were all sleeping lying across one another like kittens, only they were so long and thin they looked like strands of spaghetti.",Pets_Animals
132,5,agent_1,"Yeah, they are expensive. My parents hated that and took it right back.",Other
133,5,agent_2,"Sounds like you've had bad luck with pets. I inherited a feral cat colony when my mom died, and got them all spayed and neutered and moved them onto my place. They're really a lot of fun.",Pets_Animals
134,5,agent_1,Nice. Did you know that a seahorse is the only fish to have a neck?,Pets_Animals
135,5,agent_2,It's definitely got an unusual shape for a fish. Interesting how all land vertebrates have four limbs because we're descended from lung-fish with four weight-bearing fins.,Pets_Animals
136,5,agent_1,Interesting. I didn't know there was a jellyfish that was immortal. Did you?,Pets_Animals
137,5,agent_2,No. I remember reading there were sharks that were practically immortal though.,Pets_Animals
138,5,agent_1,"Interesting, I wonder what type they were. Well, nice chatting with you!",Phatic
139,5,agent_2,I don't think we're done quite yet.,Phatic
140,5,agent_1,"It is 10 and out, well anyways. Nice chatting with you.",Phatic
141,5,agent_2,You too!,Phatic
142,6,agent_1,Hello how are you today?,Phatic
143,6,agent_2,"Hello, I am good. How are you?  Do you listen to jazz music?",Music
144,6,agent_1,I like all music. Did you know jazz originated in the African American communities of New Orleans in the late 19th and early 20 century.,Music
145,6,agent_2,i think I did know that.  Seems like I've seen a movie that referenced it.  Didn't they combine jazz with some brass band marches or something?,Music
146,6,agent_1,It has roots in blues and ragtime.  It is now recognized as a major form of musical expression.,Music
147,6,agent_2,I'm glad.  It's world wide now too.  Pakistan has a jazz orchestra!,Music
148,6,agent_1,Cool jazz actually originated in the 1940s. It introduced calmer smoother sounds and long linear melodic lines you hear in todays jazz.,Music
149,6,agent_2,i like that. There's a lot of good music from the 40s.,Music
150,6,agent_1,Were you aware that Clint Eastwood is a lifelong jazz enthusiast.,Celebrities
151,6,agent_2,No I wasn't.  i guess going by the characters he plays in movies I just never made the connection.,Movies_TV
152,6,agent_1,Oh he is a big fan. He even scored several films including million dollar baby. That is a great movie.,Movies_TV
153,6,agent_2,He did?  What instrument does he play?,Music
154,6,agent_1,I think he played a few different instruments. There is a woman in Harlem who has held free jazz concerts at her apartment every Sunday or over 20 years.,Music
155,6,agent_2,That's cool. I bet she's pretty good to last that long.,Other
156,6,agent_1,She occasionally has top performers stop by. I wonder if Clint has ever checked it out.,Celebrities
157,6,agent_2,You never know.  He's a top performer if he can do a movie score.,Movies_TV
158,6,agent_1,I just figured it would be something that would interest him. Did you know jazz trumpeters grow out their goatees because it provides comfort while playing their instrument.,Music
159,6,agent_2,No lol! I just assumed it was for fashion.,Fashion
160,6,agent_1,So what do you think about Judge Judy making 123000 dollars per episode. I heard she retired not to long ago.,Movies_TV
161,6,agent_2,"That surprises me. I mean, i'm shocked she made so much money and that she retired.",Other
162,6,agent_1,She was the highest paid celebrity behind Lebron James. I cant believe she made that much.,Celebrities
163,6,agent_2,"I can't either.  I knew her show was popular but not that popular!  Well, I've got to go for now.  It's been nice chatting with you!  Have a great day!",Other
164,7,agent_1,Do you like beer?,Food_Drink
165,7,agent_2,"Good evening, yes I do.  How about you?",Phatic
166,7,agent_1,"It's one of my favorite alcoholic drinks, I get worried because driving under the effect of them can be dangerous",Food_Drink
167,7,agent_2,"Yes, it is and illegal and can get you put in jail with a big fine.",Politics
168,7,agent_1,Yeah its a good thing theres a robot driven ban now that can save you the jail time and the fine,SciTech
169,7,agent_2,"That's a good idea, it needs to implemented into many other cities.",Phatic
170,7,agent_1,"I agree that can save many lifes and can be a great service, the self Driving company  Drive.ai is a popular one",SciTech
171,7,agent_2,"Not to change the subject, but do you own a car?",Other
172,7,agent_1,"I do own a car yes, its a Ford what about you?",Other
173,7,agent_2,"Cool, I have an old school Cadillac Coupe De Ville, pearl white in color, just spent $ 3000 of my income tax refund on a new transmission and she drives like a top, now!",Other
174,7,agent_1,"Nice, that is a great car, you know the history behind the name Cadillac?",Other
175,7,agent_2,"No, what is the history?",Other
176,7,agent_1,"The brand was founded by a French explorer called Anoine de la Mothe Cadillac, he founded the company in Detroit",Other
177,7,agent_2,How very appropriate!  I read somewhere that it's legal to put flamethrowers on your car in South Africa to prevent carjackings.  I'm thinking about mounting me one on Nellie Belle to keep bad drivers away from her in heavy traffic.,Other
178,7,agent_1,"That is crazy!! that sounds so dangerous, thats definetely not legal on the states so be careful lol",Politics
179,7,agent_2,"Well, I wouldn't burn anybody with it on purpose.  More of an intimidation thing, if you get close enough to feel the heat from the flame you are too close, BACK OFF or your paint might get a little melted.  That's all.",Other
180,7,agent_1,"It can also work for the snow, so what forms of entertainment do you like?",Entertainment
181,7,agent_2,Video games.  What about you?,Entertainment
182,7,agent_1,"I also like video games I like to dance, music",Entertainment
183,7,agent_2,"That's cool, ever play Nintendo?",Games
184,7,agent_1,I used to have a nintendo system yeah,Games
185,7,agent_2,"It was the best, even though it could only display 54 colors.  Things have really progressed nowadays we have fortnite.",Games
186,7,agent_1,"The world of video games has changed a lot I agree, anyway its been great chatting with you really cool facts",Games
187,7,agent_2,"You too, enjoy the rest of your Friday evening.  I'm going to slap a coat of wax on ole Nellie Belle. Talk to you later, friend.",Phatic
188,8,agent_1,Do you know  much about the ancient thinkers?,Other
189,8,agent_2,I dont know a whole lot. I have heard of them before though.,Other
190,8,agent_1,"I guess there a book that can fill both you and me in, Lives of Ancient Thinkers.  Not sure I'll read it.",Literature
191,8,agent_2,Im not reeally much of a reader myself to be honest. I did read that the suns mass is about three quarters hydrogen and the rest is helium?,Literature
192,8,agent_1,"I meant to say Lives of Eminent Philosophers.  Just helium and hydrogen?  I once heard this planet is running out of helium, it will be all gone one day.",Literature
193,8,agent_2,I don't see it being possible to get it from the sun. I'm not sure what we really use helium for other than blowing up balloons,SciTech
194,8,agent_1,"Probably right, maybe some industrial usages.  Not sure I want to get too close to the sun, even if it's not as hot as a lightening bolt.",Weather_Time
195,8,agent_2,the sun produces enough energy in one second to meet our needs for 500000 years. We need to learn how to harness it.,SciTech
196,8,agent_1,"I guess that's the aim of solar panels.  Despite all that energy, it still pales into comparison with other stars in the galaxy.",SciTech
197,8,agent_2,There is a lot of work to be done with solar panels to make the cost effiecient.,Other
198,8,agent_1,"It's a process, incremental steps towards harnessing that power.  As Diogenes might have said, probably not though, Rome wasn't built in a day.",Other
199,8,agent_2,"Did you know that Caesar once visited Britain, and noted that they breed chickens for entertainment.",Entertainment
200,8,agent_1,"They really know how to have a good time there, I know there is a lack of sun there, raining all the time, maybe that had something to do with it.",SciTech
201,8,agent_2,I dont know maybe. Did you ever have a nintendo.,Games
202,8,agent_1,"No, I had an Atari back in the day, I think my younger brother may have had a Nintendo.",Games
203,8,agent_2,I loved playing nintendo when I was younger. Did you know it only could display 54 colors.,Games
204,8,agent_1,"That seems plenty to me, how many colors do you need.  I suppose it's all to do with shades of colors.  I'd have to compare then and now to see the difference.",SciTech
205,8,agent_2,I didnt notice any lack of color. I just thought it was really cool to be able to play a game on the tv. Lol.,Movies_TV
206,8,agent_1,"Hey, it's better than watching chickens.  On my old Atari we had just two colors at times, I was still addicted to it.  I should have been reading as a kid but I wasn't",Psychology
207,8,agent_2,I remember playing atari. I dont think we ever had one though. i think my cousin did. We played donkey kong.,Games
208,8,agent_1,Well it was good talking to you.  I'm going to go and read about ancient philosophers.  Goodbye.,Literature
209,8,agent_2,Have a great day.,Phatic
210,9,agent_1,did you know that unfortunately eighty percent of earth's naturally occuring forests have been eliminated?,SciTech
211,9,agent_2,"I expect that the next decade or so will show some dramatic changes in the environment. The earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago, but we are changing it quickly ourselves.",SciTech
212,9,agent_1,"yes we are, and somehow Earth was made and when that happened a day was only 5.5 hours long, that's a fast day!",SciTech
213,9,agent_2,The work day would be over before you finished commuting. The UN has an ambassador to extra terrestrials. I wonder who ended up with that job.,Other
214,9,agent_1,"haha ya I want that job, I would imagine you do a whole lot of NOTHING all day long haha",Other
215,9,agent_2,"And who is going to fire you? You can't fail at doing the job. If the aliens need helium to live, they'll have problems pretty soon. We'll be helium free by the end of the century.",Other
216,9,agent_1,"ya that is scary, do you like piano music at all? I play the piano and it's wild an aluminum grand piano was built for the Hindnburg airship, it only weight 356 pounds, I don't know if you've seen a real piano but they normally weight thousands",Music
217,9,agent_2,"I wonder about the sound of an aluminum piano. A bit tinny, I would think.",Music
218,9,agent_1,"haha ya I would like to listen to it if only the Hindenburg didn't explode, and apparently on Britains highest moutain someone had put a piano on top of it in 2006 for some reason haha",Other
219,9,agent_2,Maybe in case an airship crashed on top of the mountain?,Other
220,9,agent_1,"haha ya or to have some kind of entertainment when you get to the top? haha, I do like how Freddie Mercury used the same piano used by Paul McCartney though that is cool",Entertainment
221,9,agent_2,Have you seen the bio-pic about Freddie? Haven't seen it yet myself. I would like to see somone try to play the tune circus galop for auto-pianos.,Movies_TV

223,9,agent_2,Seems to be a lot of song-making magic in that piano. I wonder what planet will be the next in the solar system to have a piano.,Music
224,9,agent_1,haha yes or we should make a rocket ship to fly pianos around to other planets! they need to be aluminum I'm sure to save on weight haha,SciTech
225,9,agent_2,"The atmosphere would be different so the sound of the piano would be different, too.",SciTech
226,9,agent_1,"do you play any instruments? I know that Venus spins clock wise and is the only planet to do so, I wonder if that would affect my piano playing haha",SciTech
227,9,agent_2,The lack of seasons on Venus might affect inspiration for songs.,SciTech
228,9,agent_1,"yes you would have a lot less to sing about if the weather is always the same, aka bad! you'd always be in a bad mood haha",Psychology
229,9,agent_2,The building blocks of life have been detected in a aystem 455 light-years away. Maybe music would help life develop there.,SciTech
230,9,agent_1,yes that is true! I wonder if aliens would develop a piano or come up with a whole new instrument! I want to go to their rock concerts with all their alien music haha,Music
231,9,agent_2,"Sounds like fun! Well, I enjoyed chatting!",Phatic
232,9,agent_1,thank you my friend perhaps we will meet these aliens someday!,Phatic

234,10,agent_2,I'm doing great. Do you dance?,Entertainment
235,10,agent_1,ot really But I do like operea and I have seen candide,Entertainment
236,10,agent_2,Babies spontaneously dance when they hear music.,Psychology

240,10,agent_2,What is Tolkien. Is that a writer?,Literature
241,10,agent_1,he wrote lord of the rings and the hobbit,Literature
242,10,agent_2,I thought that is who you meant. I loved the Hobbit. So different than other stories out there.,Literature
243,10,agent_1,I never would of thought Tupac did Ballet,Celebrities
244,10,agent_2,I know and to be able to act too in the Nutcracker.,Other
245,10,agent_1,Ballet is tough on the body if they go through 4 pairs of shoes a week,Other
246,10,agent_2,It would seem to be expensive too if you have to buy that many shoes. I wonder it they are expensive to buy?,Other
247,10,agent_1,"they must be, I also did not know Bruce Lee was a champion dancer",Celebrities
248,10,agent_2,"And the cha-cha at that! Out of all the dances in the world, he must have really liked the beat.",Celebrities
249,10,agent_1,I wonder if he moved really fast,Other
250,10,agent_2,I would hope that he would keep the beat but if he added extra leg movements he could have really looked like he was moving all over the place.,Other
251,10,agent_1,I wonder if he would give my jackson a run for his money even with his patented shoes?,Other
252,10,agent_2,"Probably, except for the deep lean that Michael was famous for.",Celebrities
253,10,agent_1,"lol, it was nice talking to you",Other
254,10,agent_2,Nice talking with you too. Have a great day!,Phatic
255,11,agent_1,Hey are you a big golf fan? It is so popular in our country!,Sports
256,11,agent_2,"No, I don't really watch golf or participate in the sport.  I do think the courses are beautiful though.",Sports
257,11,agent_1,Yes they are. Golf courses in USA take up more space than Rhode Island and delaware combined.,Sports
258,11,agent_2,"That is true, it's not something that I realized.  I think that it's still a good thing to have as both a sport and a form of exercise.",Sports
259,11,agent_1,Yes for sure. Many people play golf even actors like Samuel L. Jackson.,Celebrities
260,11,agent_2,"True, I was surprised that he was allowed to put a clause in his film contract that would allow him to play twice a week during production.",Movies_TV
261,11,agent_1,Yeah smart guy to do that! Babe Ruth was also a famous golfer at one point.,Celebrities
262,11,agent_2,That was another surprising thing that I didn't realize.  I guess it makes sense because he was both an athlete and played outdoors a lot.,Other
263,11,agent_1,"Yeah. The average american golf course uses 312,000 gallons of water per day. Wow.",Sports
264,11,agent_2,I thought that was a lot of water that is used per day.  I guess that's one of the downsides of the game.,Sports
265,11,agent_1,Yeah for sure. There is even one in Dubai that requires 4 million gallons per day.,Other
266,11,agent_2,The one in Dubai seems a bit excessive.  I wonder why the usage is so much there?,Other
267,11,agent_1,Probably because its a desert I assume and they go through so much. It's interesting how its one of the few sports that doesn't have a standardized play area.,Travel_Geo
268,11,agent_2,I guess that a probable explanation.  I guess that is one of the drawbacks of the game.,Games
269,11,agent_1,Yeah. It's funny when people dance after they get a whole in one. Dance is cool because it has aesthetic and symbolic value.,Entertainment
270,11,agent_2,Dance does have a lot of positive values.  It can also be fun and a form of exercise.,Entertainment
271,11,agent_1,Yeah true. Although I don't want to do ballet because they use so many shoes.,Other
272,11,agent_2,That would be pretty expensive I would think!  I think it's amazing that babies spontaneously dance when they hear music and smile more when they hit the beat.,Other
273,11,agent_1,Haha that is so cute. Bruce Lee was a championship dancer!,Celebrities
274,11,agent_2,I think it's funny that Bruce Lee won the Hong Kong cha-cha championship in 1958.  I bet he was pretty good!  I also thought it interesting that Michael Jackson had a patent on a device used to achieve the extreme lean in his dance moves.,Celebrities
275,11,agent_1,I would love to try that! Explains how he did that move. He was an amazing dancer!!,Other
276,12,agent_1,"Duterte's joke was in incredibly poor taste, considering his strict ""war on drugs""  What do you think about his comment?",Politics
277,12,agent_2,I know.  He is a dictator.  He does not care about what others say about him.,Politics
278,12,agent_1,I heard that almost 5000 Philippine people have been killed in the past couple of years because of his policies.  It's awful.,Politics
279,12,agent_2,"Yes, the killings began in 2016.",Politics
280,12,agent_1,"Speaking of dictatorships, what do you think about the Vox party gaining seats in Spain?",Politics
281,12,agent_2,I don't know what will happen.  The socialist group is losing control.,Politics
282,12,agent_1,"It might be beneficial that all parties have to work together to make decisions, that way one won't dominate over the other.",Politics
283,12,agent_2,True.  People in spain are concerned about illegal immigration.,Politics
284,12,agent_1,"It's interesting, it's seems that the far-right is always running on anti-immigration sentiments.",Politics
285,12,agent_2,"Prime minister Pedro, is he with the right or the left group?",Politics
286,12,agent_1,"I don't know for sure, he is in the minority government, so he's not with the Socialist party.",Politics
287,12,agent_2,"So, he might be with the right group.  If he could win when he was with the minority that he would be more powerful if he is with the majority.",Politics
288,12,agent_1,"Yes, and I bet he will heed the call for early national elections because of it.",Politics
289,12,agent_2,You are probably right.  I hope Spain would not go back to fascism.,Politics
290,12,agent_1,"What's going on with Garcia, the former Peruvian president?",Politics
291,12,agent_2,I am not sure but I think he has a legal problem.  Corruption?,Politics
292,12,agent_1,"Yeah, something to do with illegal construction payments. I think the US Justice Dept uncovered it.",Politics
293,12,agent_2,I wonder how our Justice Dep uncovered the bribery.,Politics
294,12,agent_1,"It was during a plea deal for someone else, sometime in 2016.  Almost $800 million in bribes for government contracts.",Politics
295,12,agent_2,I wonder if the contractors were American businesses.  Corruption is rampant in that part of the world.,Politics
296,12,agent_1,I think it's rampant everywhere!  Look at Sri Lanka!,Politics
297,12,agent_2,I read about it too.  Prime Minister Rajapaksa is in a big trouble too.,Politics
298,12,agent_1,"Seriously, he's barely holding onto power.  The people have no confidence in him.",Politics
299,12,agent_2,You are right.  I have to run.  It was nice chatting with you.  Bye.,Phatic
300,13,agent_1,Hi! Have you ever remodeled a house?,Phatic
301,13,agent_2,Yes once. It cost twice as much as estimated and took twice as long.,Other
302,13,agent_1,"Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of especially since I'm stripping down walls and replacing it to cater to millennials with a more modern vibe.",Other
303,13,agent_2,"I feel sorry for you, let them eat cake!",Phatic
304,13,agent_1,"Yeah, that's the same for cars, I'm not sure how long I should hold a car for, but McDonald's actually invented the drive-thru to accommodate soldiers who weren't allowed to get out of their cars while in uniforms. I use the drive thru lanes pretty frequently!",SciTech
305,13,agent_2,"Yes, I heard that about McDs. Personally, I keep a car until it dies and refuses to run again, but then possessions mean nothing to me, only their usefulness.",Other
306,13,agent_1,"Oh ok, that's some great insight, people have been telling me to trade in a car after about five years so I'd at least get some value out of it. Crazy to think how far we've come along since horse carriages and wooden trunks!",Other
307,13,agent_2,"People all have different ideas about the worth of things. I haven't bought a new car for decades only used, and I pay cash. No debt, only liability insurance, and never pay more than 5K they last on average 5 years before serious problems occur and then you just walk away.",SciTech
308,13,agent_1,"Oh wow, I think that's some great insight! Just scared cars might break down on me and I have no idea how to fix anything and anytime cars requires fixing, its several hundred dollars!",SciTech
309,13,agent_2,"I used to work on them when I was a kid, but now they are too complicated and take computers to trouble shoot.",SciTech
310,13,agent_1,"Oh yeah, and with countries like South Africa where its legal to equip cars with flame-throwers, I guess that doesn't help either. I wonder if the cars come equipped with a ""launch"" button",SciTech
311,13,agent_2,That is amazing. What a neat way to get through traffic jams. I guess each country has a certain way they want their cars to look and perform. I just read that there is an arrow mnext to the gas symbol on your car that tells you which side you have to pump on.,SciTech
312,13,agent_1,"Yes~! I actually only recently learned about that too, that comes extremely useful when I'm in rental cars. Do you listen to any music or anything when you're driving in your car?",Music
313,13,agent_2,"An oldie station, though their idea of oldies keep advancing through time. Guess that happens to all of us. I love music however.",Music
314,13,agent_1,"Yeah, oldies do advance through time, I also love music, I wished I played an instrument. Steven Spielberg even played the clarinet for the Jaws soundtrack, as if he wasn't talented enough already.",Music
315,13,agent_2,"I didn't know that. I never played either, all thumbs when it comes to the dexterity needed to play.",Music
316,13,agent_1,"Haha, even at 100 years, Japan still released rap albums of two twins! I wonder how many people bought their songs.",Music

322,14,agent_2,i have cut it. i do not like to watch the tv. it is a distraction and a time waster. do you still subscribe?,Movies_TV
323,14,agent_1,I have cut the cord as well.  I can get local news / weather with an over-the-air antenna.  I still watch via streaming (Netflix and Amazon Prime) - no commercials and I can stop at anytime or binge watch if I want to.  Did you know that there are more than 750 episodes of Pokemon.  That's more than 250 hours or 10 days of binge watching!,Other
324,14,agent_2,please do not binge watch pokemon. that will destroy your brain. you must resist! remain strong!,Movies_TV
325,14,agent_1,"It is not something I would binge watch.  But some comedies are worth it (over several days).  Like ""3rd Rock from the Sun"".  Did you know it beat out Seinfeld, Friends, and Frasier for the 1998 Golden Globe for Best Comedy Series?",Movies_TV
326,14,agent_2,"it must be a great show to binge watch. i will put 3rd rock on my binge list. it is not a new show, but it must be a classic",Movies_TV
327,14,agent_1,"it ended in the early 2000s.  Another one I stream from time to time is the Simpsons.  When I am in the right mindset, it can be an entertaining political satire / comedy.  Bart is so essential to the show that there is only one episode in which he does not appear or is mentioned!",Movies_TV
328,14,agent_2,i will look for that episode! i wonder if it is really that funny without bart in it. he is the best!,Movies_TV
329,14,agent_1,"I agree.  Earlier I brought up Seinfield.  Did you follow his series ""Comedians in Cars"" on Netflix?",Movies_TV

331,14,agent_1,"Its an impromptu dialogue on the way to a coffee shop often in a vitage / classic car.  It went on for 9 seasons.  So are you a car, truck, or SUV person?",Other

In a bit of trivia, did you know it is legal to have flame throwers on your vehicle to prevent carjacking?  I wonder if auto theft is higher there than here?  It certainly implies it!",Other
334,14,agent_2,There is a lot of crime there.,Other
335,14,agent_1,"Well, one thing I cannot do with my truck is go thru the McD's drive-thru.  Its a Ford F-350 with dual rear tires, so it sits too far out to make the food / money exchange.  I thought McD put drive thru as a way to bring in more customers (and it did that too) but it was for GIs who could not get out of their cars wearing regulation fatigues!",Other
336,14,agent_2,that is great! good for mcd's. they were thoughtful of the customers that needed them the most. military food is terrible! and fast food is necessary for good morale among the troops! LOL,Food_Drink

339,14,agent_1,"Very good point!  I don't have because of the cost.  If we go on a roadtrip, then I will download stuff to the Ipad for the kids, like Thomas the Tank Engine for the youngest.

341,14,agent_1,"True, he may be a beloved comedian, but I would have never considered him a narrator for a ""G"" rated young kids show.  Neither would have I thought Alec Baldwin to be able to hold his tongue and narrate Thomas as well for more than 50 episodes!",Celebrities

344,14,agent_2,"I do like the Python. they made some great movies, like holy grail.",Movies_TV

350,15,agent_1,"1/3 of all divorce fillings? wow that is crazy, I guess Facebook can be a dangerous tool if you forget to log out or give a like to the wrong picture",SciTech
351,15,agent_2,I agree. It can also be the source of much fake news. 30% of Americans rely on Facebook as their primary source of news!,News

353,15,agent_2,"No, what was that about? And I would not trust facebook as my primary news source either. They have no credibility",News
354,15,agent_1,"I agree, there are a lot of fake news in the media, and the promotion was about unfriending 10 friends on Facebook, you would get a free whopper by doing that",News

415,18,agent_2,Yes I watch baseball from time to time. It's interesting how both teams take turns batting and Fielding,Sports
416,18,agent_1,It is. Do you happen to know why baseball managers wear uniforms?,Sports
417,18,agent_2,"Yes I do, I think it's because they can actually play in the game if necessary right? Did you know that a seventeen-year-old actually struck out Babe Ruth? I wonder what became of her",Celebrities

471,20,agent_1,The remake was really bad so bad it got cancelled after only 10 episodes,Movies_TV
472,20,agent_2,"yikes, I wonder how many careers that killed. Probably a different style of humor that the UK doesn't like",Other

484,21,agent_1,Over 5 seasons he has been an MLS all-star.,Sports
